Did you know that in the 1960s, Top Bowlers made twice as much as Professional football players? Imagine a bowler making twice the amount of Tom Brady! [SEP] Yeah that's weird however did you know his wife makes twice as much as him now? [SEP] *leans slightly forward* No I did not. Wow! An engineer would make more than Tom Brady if you compared their lifetime earnings. That is probably due to how few years football can be played professionally.",

I think that the game is more complex than I thought. [SEP] *opens mouth slightly* What do you think they do with that data? It is surprisingly complex considering the fact that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay. [SEP] The game is only 11 minutes? That seems too short. Why so short?",

Maybe our next election can feature a sing-off.  If the President of Indonesia can release three pop music albums, it might just work!  lol [SEP] I think that would be quite entertaining!

[SEP] *squints eyes* Yeah, that is about my opinion too. I am guessing it is his plan for making money when he has to leave the sport. [SEP] *squints eyes* probably setting himself up for some sort of supplement company or books or something. He can't really believe all the stuff he is saying. It is just ridiculous. [SEP] I agree.

Given their intentions and the great writers do you believe it will have an impact on the public's perception on Puerto Rico and its history? [SEP] *eyes widen* I think it might. Especially after the hurricane that hit there. They had a lot of economic problems before it hit. [SEP] Yeah, I hope so too.
